# Library-Management-System

Library Management System offers many flexible and convenient features, allowing librarians and library users to maximize time and efficiency. This system gives all the detailed information about students, staff, and books. It will keep a track of the books available in the library and books issued to the students. It shows popular books among the students and most frequent users of the library. It also records all and any transactions, making it easier to implement a fine module, integrated within the system, which charges the tardy of the student in returning the book. A basic search feature makes it easier for the student to navigate around the system.
